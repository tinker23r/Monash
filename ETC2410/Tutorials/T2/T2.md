## Question 1

1. Obtain the summary statistic and histogram of GDPPC. Discuss what you can learn from the histogram and summary statistics. If you had a different set of 26 countries with GDP per capita of less than $50/day, would the summary statistics be the same?

The graph is bimodal with one peak at 

2. We want to explore the association between under_5 mortality and GDP per capita for lower than median income countries. What kind of a graph can give us an insight into the nature of this relationship? Based on this graph, are under_5 mortality and GDP per capita positively or negatively correlated? Is their relationship linear?

## Question 2

1. Plot the WAGE series (plotting a time series means producing a line plot of the series in which the x-axis is time. In EViews, clicking on a series opens a window that shows the value of the series in a spreadsheet. This window has a menu bar. Under View is Graph. And the default for Graph is a line plot). What can we learn from this plot? (Note that this is a wage index with average hourly wage in 2008-2009 financial year normalised to 100. So, the numbers are proportional to hourly wage, but are not the dollar values).


2. If we were interested in forecasting hourly wage index in the next period, would sample average be a good forecast? Suggest more appropriate forecasts.
