I agree because this observation is an outlier,
because it is around five standard deviations from the sample mean.
This is an unusual observation because it is unlikely
that someone can survive less than 2 hours sleep per night.

2b
- H0: bkid=0
- H1: bkid ~= 0
- t=bkidhat/se(bkidhat)=-144.54/88.12
- under H0 t is t(n-k-1) distributed
- t=-144.54/88.12=-1.640
- critical value: t(305-5-1) approx 1.658
- absolute value of the test statistic is smaller than 1.658,
so cannot reject H0: that having a child under the age of 5 has
no effect on a mother's sleep.

2c
coef educ=-12.5 and se coef=9
t(305-5-1)=t(299) approx 1.98

- 95% confidence interval beduc
- -12.5-1.98*9=-30.32 and -12.5+1.98*9=5.32
- 95% confidence interval for a change of one year in education
- 95% confidence interval for 4*beduc
-[-121.28,21.28]

2d
first derivative of -43*AGE+0.5*AGE2:
-43+0.5*2*AGE
the predicted sleep is at its minimum when -43+0.5*2*AGE=0,
that is AGE=43

2e
- H0: bedu=bkid=0
- H1: at least one of these coefs is not equal to zero
- F = ((Rur2-Rr2)/q)/((1-Rur2)/(n-k-1))
- distribution F under H0: F(q,n-k-1)
- Fcalc = ((0.104-0.092)/2)/((1-0.104)/(305-5-1))=2.00
- Fcrit = F(2,299) approx 3.07
- Fcalc is smaller than Fcrit, so we cannot reject H0
- After controlling for work and age, 
education and kids have no additional explanatory power
for predicting sleep for women.

2f
- H0: bYHAT=bYHAT2=0
- Ha: at least one of the coefs is not equal to zero
- W = n*R2
- asymptotic distribution under H0: Chi2(q)
- Wcalc = 305*0.001=0.305
- Wcrit = Chi2(2)=5.99
- Wcalc is smaller than Wcrit, so we cannot reject H0.
- No evidence of heteroskedasticity in the errors of equation 1.

2bi
a) the sign of the slope coefficient is positive
b) firms with small assets are tightly located around the
regression line, while firms with bigger assets are located
further away from the regression line. 
So conditional variance is not constant for all observations.
- with heteroskedasticty, OLS is still unbiased,
but no longer BLUE, and the usual OLS se are no longer correct.
This means that we cannot perform F and t tests based on
these se.
- log-log transformation is not possible as we have firms
with negative profits.

2bii
Var(u|x)=s2=sigma^2

- Var(W*u|x)=W2*Var(u|X)=(1/(assets))*Var(u|X) = s2
If var(u|X)=assets*s2 we have constant variance in 
the estimated equation, and the estimator is BLUE
- In the weighted equation we have constant variance and therefore
there is no heteroskedasticity. We also have the same parameters
as in (6), so we can estimate the coefficients in a model
without heteroskedasticity

2biii

- H0: b2=b3=0
- Ha: at least one of them is not zero
- F=((SSRr-SSRur)/q)/(SSRur/(n-k-1))
- distribution under H0: F(q,n-k-1)
- Fcalc=((27.95-25.32)/2)/(25.32/(69-3-1))=3.37
- Fcrit=F(2,69-3-1)=4.98
- test statistic is smaller than the critical value
- We cannot reject H0, so there is evidence 
that whether the manager is the owner or not matters in
the relationship between profits and assets.

a)
ut is white noise
- E[ut]=0 for all t
- Var[ut]=s2 for all t
- Cov(ut,u(t+s))=0 for all t not equal to s
ALSO CORRECT: ut is iid(0,s2)

bi)
ut is not white noise
but is likely to be serially correlated,
because the autocorrelations are 
significantly different from zero.
The pac suggest an AR(2) model for ut

bii)
ut = rho1*u(t-1)+rho2*u(t-2)+et

-H0: rho1=rho2=0
-Ha: at least on is not equal to zero

Estimate (11) and construct uthat
Auxiliarly regression: 
Regress uthat on c, Pbeef, Pchicken, INC, t, 
u(t-1)hat and u(t-2)hat

-> uthat=a0+a1*Pbeef+a2*Pchicken+a3*INC+a4*t+a5*u(t-1)hat
+a6*u(t-2)hat+et
Get R2aux

- BG=(n-2)*R2aux
- asymptotic distribution under H0: chi2(2)
- if BGcalc>BGcrit, then we reject H0

3biii
Raux2=0.658

calculate the test statistic: (n-q)*Raux2=(150-2)*0.658=97.384
critical value: chi2(2)=5.99
conclusion: BGcalc>BGcrit we reject the H0.
There is significant serial correlation in the errors.

3biv
under serial correlation, OLS is still unbiased, but no longer BLUE.
The standard formula for the standard errors is incorrect.
We can use HAC standard errors.
