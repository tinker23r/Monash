1) What are the real life examples of events with Markov Property?

Definition of Markov Property
The Markov property means that evolution of the Markov process in the future depends only on the present state and does not depend on past history. The Markov process does not remember the past if the present state is given. Hence, the Markov process is called the process with memoryless property.

2) Which context is appropriate to use the White noise as the model? 

  If the variables are independent and identically distributed with a mean of zero then a White Noise is applied to the model which means that one cannot reasonably model it and make predictions.
